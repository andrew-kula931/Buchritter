## Buch Ritter (Book Knight)

A small website consisting of a documents (richtext editors) that can be organized into folders. The application features a recusion based file system very similar to that of most operating systems' directory/file relationship. A literature review section is also in development.

#### Purpose of this project

This project was my first go at React and working with a server. I find that it was rather successful all things considered as the current product is rather stable and lacks any known major bugs.

#### What I learned

As I said before, this was my first attempt to use React which I am now much more familiar with. I also used software such as prisma and Sqlite to manage the database. Finally, I got more experience with networking tools, particularly the service Render and building a CICD pipeline. For a more complete and self governed CICD pipeline check out my other repo: https://github.com/andrew-kula931/WorkingItOut

#### Final Product

Despite the timeline ending for this project, I plan on making small additions in the future for my own experience and because I think, with a little polishing, I could unironically use it. For now, click on the link above to see the demo.
